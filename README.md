Community-Driven Game Experiment This project began as an experiment in AI-assisted development, using Grok to generate the initial game code. We believe this is just the starting point.

The goal is to see how much we can improve it together. Whether you're refining the AI-generated prompts, rewriting core mechanics, or adding new features, all contributions are welcome. Let's make this game more fun and engaging through collaboration.# game003_ShootingGame# game004_ShootingGame
